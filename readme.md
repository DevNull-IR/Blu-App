## Why?

Because the "blu" bank PWA is limited to mobile devices and you'd have problems using it in your PC.

## How to use?

1. Open your chromium-based browser. (Chrome, Edge, Yandex, etc.)
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` or open extensions menu.
3. Switch on __Developer mode__.
4. Download zip file [here](https://github.com/DevNull-IR/Blu-App/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Unpack file somewhere and choose __Load unpacked__ and choose extension folder.
5. Go to blubank PWA site: https://app.blubank.com
6. Install or make a shortcut of the site while having Open As Window option checked.
